<h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</h1>
<p><em>By William Shakespeare</em>
</p>
<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
<br>Thou art more <em>lovely</em> and more <strong>temperate.</strong>
<br>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
<br>And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date.</sup>
</p>
<br>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
<br>And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds;</sub>
<br>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
<br>By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
<p>
<br>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
<br>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
<br>Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
<br>When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
<br>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
<br>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
